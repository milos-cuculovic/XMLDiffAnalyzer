        <title>Flow Monitoring</title>
        <p>River systems and stream flows can be monitored by remotely integrating the techniques of water body observation, vegetation mapping, DEM generation, and hydrological modelling. Satellite sensors in the visible, infrared, and microwave ranges are currently used to monitor rivers and to delineate flood zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136-remotesensing-10-00641">136</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137-remotesensing-10-00641">137</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138-remotesensing-10-00641">138</xref>]. These methods are generally used only over large rivers or areas of inundation in order to detect changes at the pixel level. UAS can describe river dynamics, but with a level of detail that is several orders of magnitude greater and can enable distributed flow measurements over any river system and in difficult-to-access environments.</p>
        <p>In this context, the integration of UAS imagery and optical velocimetry techniques has enabled full remote kinematic characterization of water bodies and surface flows. Optical techniques, such as Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139-remotesensing-10-00641">139</xref>]) and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140-remotesensing-10-00641">140</xref>]), are efficient yet nonintrusive flow visualization methods that yield a spatially distributed estimation of the surface flow velocity field based on the similarity of image sequences. Proof-of-concept experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of applying LSPIV from manned aerial systems to monitor flood events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141-remotesensing-10-00641">141</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B142-remotesensing-10-00641">142</xref>]. More recently, videos recorded from a UAS have been analyzed with LSPIV to reconstruct surface flow velocity fields of natural stream reaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143-remotesensing-10-00641">143</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144-remotesensing-10-00641">144</xref>]. This provides a detailed Lagrangian insight into river dynamics that is valuable in calibrating numerical models. </p>
        <p>Most of these experimental observations entail a low-cost UAS hovering above the region of interest for a few seconds (the observation time should be adjusted to the flow velocity and camera acquisition frequency). An RGB camera is typically mounted onboard and installed with its optical axis perpendicular to the captured field of view to circumvent orthorectification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145-remotesensing-10-00641">145</xref>]. To facilitate remote photometric calibration, Tauro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145-remotesensing-10-00641">145</xref>] adopted a UAS equipped with a system of four lasers that focus points at known distances in the field of view. In several experimental settings, the accuracy of surface flow velocity estimations from UAS was found to be comparable to (or even better than) that of traditional ground-based LSPIV configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B146-remotesensing-10-00641">146</xref>]. In fact, compared to fixed implementations, UAS enable capture of larger fields of view with a diffuse rather than direct illumination. Such optical image velocimetry techniques can measure flow velocity fields over extended regions rather than pointwise, and at temporal resolutions comparable to or even better than Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) based on the presence of detectable features on the water surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147-remotesensing-10-00641">147</xref>].</p>
        <p>In this context, UAS technology is expected to considerably aid in flood monitoring and mapping. In fact, flood observation is a considerable challenge for space-borne passive imagery, mostly due to the presence of dense cloud cover, closed vegetation canopies, and the satellite revisit time and viewing angle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B133-remotesensing-10-00641">133</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B148-remotesensing-10-00641">148</xref>]. Although SAR satellite sensors (e.g., Sentinel-1, TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT-2) can overcome these visibility limitations, they are unable to provide the submeter-level spatial resolution necessary for detailed understanding of flood routing and susceptibility. Applying UAS with an appropriate flight mode may overcome some of these issues, allowing for rapid and safe monitoring of inundations and measurement of flood hydrological parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149-remotesensing-10-00641">149</xref>]. This is possible also because most platforms are quite stable in windy conditions (less than 5 m/s in the case of multirotors).</p>
        <p>Challenges for the widespread adoption and incorporation of UAS for flow monitoring have commonalities with both agricultural and ecosystems monitoring, including the coupling of measurements from multiple sensors through accurate and efficient processing workflows. Specific to streamflow measurement, these include (i) optimization of SfM workflows to enable extraction of terrestrial and subsurface topographies through accurate image registration using automatic or direct georeferencing techniques; (ii) the determination of water levels through image- (e.g., SfM; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B150-remotesensing-10-00641">150</xref>]), sensor- (e.g., laser, radar; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B151-remotesensing-10-00641">151</xref>]), and turbulence-derived metrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B152-remotesensing-10-00641">152</xref>]; and (iii) the derivation of flow velocities through appropriate techniques (e.g., PIV/PTV), based on the characteristics of flow, duration of observation, seeding density, etc.). The task of combining these data and developing workflows that are capable of rapidly producing synoptic river flow measurements based on the range of available inputs is an ongoing challenge to ensure UAS-based measurements are able to fully support water resource management and civil protection agencies.</p>
        <p>In this context, hyperspectral sensors can also be used to extend the range of water monitoring applications. Potential examples include sediment concentration, chlorophyll distribution, blooming algae status, submerged vegetation mapping, bathymetry, and chemical and organic waste contaminations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B153-remotesensing-10-00641">153</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B154-remotesensing-10-00641">154</xref>].</p>
