            <p>
                Satellite data are widely used to monitor natural hazards (e.g., floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfire, etc.) at national and international scales [
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131-remotesensing-10-00641">131</xref>
                ]. This popularity is due to their wide coverage, spectral resolution, safety, and rate of update [
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B132-remotesensing-10-00641">132</xref>

                ]. Nevertheless, UAS have also been adopted for rapid assessment following natural extreme events and in the context of humanitarian relief and infrastructure assessment [
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-remotesensing-10-00641">28</xref>
                ]. According to Quaritsch et al. [
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134-remotesensing-10-00641">134</xref>
                ], UAS should be utilized as a component of a network of sensors for natural disaster management. Although there are a number of technological barriers, which must be overcome before UAS can be utilized in a more automated and coordinated manner, their potential for disaster response is significant [
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135-remotesensing-10-00641">135</xref>
                ]. Given the UAS potential, we expect significant advances in the fields of hydrology, geomorphology, and hydraulics, where there is a significant opportunity for the use of UAS for monitoring river systems, overland flows, or even urban floods.

                <p>
                    River systems and stream flows can be monitored by remotely integrating the techniques of water body observation, vegetation mapping, DEM generation, and hydrological modelling. Satellite sensors in the visible, infrared, and microwave ranges are currently used to monitor rivers and to delineate flood zones [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136-remotesensing-10-00641">136</xref>

                    ]. These methods are generally used only over large rivers or areas of inundation in order to detect changes at the pixel level. UAS can describe river dynamics, but with a level of detail that is several orders of magnitude greater and can enable distributed flow measurements over any river system and in difficult-to-access environments.

                <p>
                    In this context, the integration of UAS imagery and optical velocimetry techniques has enabled full remote kinematic characterization of water bodies and surface flows. Optical techniques, such as Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV, [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139-remotesensing-10-00641">139</xref>
                    ]) and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140-remotesensing-10-00641">140</xref>
                    ]), are efficient yet nonintrusive flow visualization methods that yield a spatially distributed estimation of the surface flow velocity field based on the similarity of image sequences. Proof-of-concept experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of applying LSPIV from manned aerial systems to monitor flood events [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141-remotesensing-10-00641">141</xref>

                    ]. More recently, videos recorded from a UAS have been analyzed with LSPIV to reconstruct surface flow velocity fields of natural stream reaches [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143-remotesensing-10-00641">143</xref>

                    ]. This provides a detailed Lagrangian insight into river dynamics that is valuable in calibrating numerical models.

                <p>
                    Most of these experimental observations entail a low-cost UAS hovering above the region of interest for a few seconds (the observation time should be adjusted to the flow velocity and camera acquisition frequency). An RGB camera is typically mounted onboard and installed with its optical axis perpendicular to the captured field of view to circumvent orthorectification [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145-remotesensing-10-00641">145</xref>
                    ]. To facilitate remote photometric calibration, Tauro et al. [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145-remotesensing-10-00641">145</xref>
                    ] adopted a UAS equipped with a system of four lasers that focus points at known distances in the field of view. In several experimental settings, the accuracy of surface flow velocity estimations from UAS was found to be comparable to (or even better than) that of traditional ground-based LSPIV configurations [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B146-remotesensing-10-00641">146</xref>
                    ]. In fact, compared to fixed implementations, UAS enable capture of larger fields of view with a diffuse rather than direct illumination. Such optical image velocimetry techniques can measure flow velocity fields over extended regions rather than pointwise, and at temporal resolutions comparable to or even better than Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) based on the presence of detectable features on the water surface [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147-remotesensing-10-00641">147</xref>

                <p>
                    In this context, UAS technology is expected to considerably aid in flood monitoring and mapping. In fact, flood observation is a considerable challenge for space-borne passive imagery, mostly due to the presence of dense cloud cover, closed vegetation canopies, and the satellite revisit time and viewing angle [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B133-remotesensing-10-00641">133</xref>

                    ]. Although SAR satellite sensors (e.g., Sentinel-1, TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT-2) can overcome these visibility limitations, they are unable to provide the submeter-level spatial resolution necessary for detailed understanding of flood routing and susceptibility. Applying UAS with an appropriate flight mode may overcome some of these issues, allowing for rapid and safe monitoring of inundations and measurement of flood hydrological parameters [
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149-remotesensing-10-00641">149</xref>
                    ]. This is possible also because most platforms are quite stable in windy conditions (less than 5 m/s in the case of multirotors).

                    Challenges for the widespread adoption and incorporation of UAS for flow monitoring have commonalities with both agricultural and ecosystems monitoring, including the coupling of measurements from multiple sensors through accurate and efficient processing workflows. Specific to streamflow measurement, these include (i) optimization of SfM workflows to enable extraction of terrestrial and subsurface topographies through accurate image registration using automatic or direct georeferencing techniques; (ii) the determination of water levels through image- (e.g., SfM; [

                    ]; and (iii) the derivation of flow velocities through appropriate techniques (e.g., PIV/PTV), based on the characteristics of flow, duration of observation, seeding density, etc.). The task of combining these data and developing workflows that are capable of rapidly producing synoptic river flow measurements based on the range of available inputs is an ongoing challenge to ensure UAS-based measurements are able to fully support water resource management and civil protection agencies.

            <p>UAS-based remote sensing provides new advanced procedures to monitor key variables, including vegetation status, soil moisture content, and stream flow. A detailed description of such variables will increase our capacity to describe water resource availability and assist agricultural and ecosystem management. Our manuscript provides an overview of some of the recent applications in field-based UAS surficial environmental monitoring. The wide range of applications testifies to the great potential of these techniques, but, at the same time, the variety of methodologies adopted is evidence that there is still need for harmonization efforts. The variety of available platforms, sensors, and specificity of any particular case study have stimulated a proliferation of a huge number of specific algorithms addressing flight planning, image registration, calibration and correction, and derivation of indices or variables. However, there is no evidence of comprehensive comparative studies that enable the user to select the most appropriate procedure for any specific need.</p>

                A review of the literature carried out herein allowed the identification of a number of outstanding issues in the use of UAS for environmental monitoring. Among others, we selected the following that require specific attention:

                            There are also technical limits, such as weather constraints (strong wind and/or rain), high elevations, or high-temperature environments that can be challenging for most of the devices/sensors and respective UAS operators (see, e.g., [

                        <p>Finally, a disadvantage in the use of UAS is represented by the complexity associated to their use that is comparable to that of satellites. In fact, satellite applications are generally associated to a chain of processing assuring the final quality of data. In the case of UAS, all this is left to the final user or researcher, requiring additional steps in order to be able to use the retrieved data.</p>

                </list>
            </p>
                  
            <p>
                It should be recognized that the UAS sector has received much less funding to address the existing gaps in technology and processing chains needed to produce useable images than, for instance, satellite-based programs (
                <xref ref-type="fig" rid="remotesensing-10-00641-f005">Figure 5</xref>
                ). However, this is one of the reasons why there is much potential for further improvements in the technology and its use. One particular benefit of UAV improvements is related to the potential benefit that could be directed towards satellite-based observations, which can leverage the utilization of highly detailed UAS data. Given the spatiotemporal advantage of UAS systems, they can provide much higher return periods, offering several flights per day to study very dynamic processes at high spatial resolution, such as physiological response of vegetation to heat or even rapid flooding events. The combination of these data allows an advanced satellite test-bed for examining scale effects due to spatial resolution, identifying the most suitable acquisition time, establishing the effects of temporal resolution, incorporating suitable spectral bands, and establishing needed radiometric resolution, etc., all of which provide feedback to developing improved space-borne platforms in a way that ground-based monitoring alone can never replicate. Moreover, the capability to achieve a resolution comparable with the scale of field measurements gives the opportunity to address the issue of within-pixel spatial heterogeneity observed by satellites.

                With time, natural selection will likely deliver the most efficient collection and processing solutions for different contexts and applications, but there is still a significant amount of work needed to drive this change. Therefore, a major challenge for the scientific community is to foster this process by providing some guidance in the wide range of possibilities offered by the market. On the other side of this, the private sector of UAS developers are also investing in this field, accelerating the evolution of the technology. Among the many advances, it is interesting to mention the following:
                <list list-type="bullet">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>
                            One of the aspects directly impacting the area that is able to be sensed is the limited flight times of UAS. This problem is currently managed by mission planning that enables management of multiple flights. Technology is also offering new solutions that will extend the flight endurance up to several hours, making the use of UAS more competitive. For instance, new developments in batteries suggest that the relatively short flying time imposed by current capacity will be significantly improved in the future [
                            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B156-remotesensing-10-00641">156</xref>
                            ]. In this context, another innovation introduced in the most recent vehicles is an integrated energy supply system connected with onboard solar panels that allow flight endurance to be extended from 40–50 min up to 5 h, depending on the platform.
                        </p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The relative ground sampling distance affects the quality of the surveys, but is often not compensated for. This limitation can now be solved by implementing 3D flight paths that follow the surface in order to maintain a uniform GSD. Currently, only a few software suites (e.g., UgCS, eMotion 3) use digital terrain models to adjust the height path of the mission in order to maintain consistent GSD.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The influence of GSD may be reduced by increasing flight height, making UAS even more cost-competitive (by increasing sensed areas), but current legislation in many jurisdictions limits this to between 120 and 150 m and to within visible line of sight (VLOS). In this context, the development of microdrones will significantly reduce risk associated with their use, and relax some of the constraints due to safety requirements.</p>

                        <p>Recent and rapid developments in sensor miniaturization, standardization, and cost reduction have opened new possibilities for UAS applications. However, limits remain, especially for commercial readymade platforms that are used the most among the scientific community.</p>

                        <p>Sensor calibration remains an issue, especially for hyperspectral sensors. For example, vegetation can be measured in its state and distribution using RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, and thermal cameras, as well as with LiDAR.</p>

                        <p>Image registration, correction, and calibration remain major challenges. The vulnerability of UAS to weather conditions (wind, rain) and the geometric and radiometric limitations of current lightweight sensors have stimulated the development of new algorithms for image mosaicking and correction. In this context, the development of open source and commercial SfM software allows image mosaicking to be addressed, but radiometric correction and calibration is still an open question that may find a potential solution through experience with EO. Moreover, the development of new mapping-quality cameras has already significantly improved spatial registration and will likely help to also improve the overall quality of the UAS imagery.</p>

            <p>Technological advances are strongly supporting the diffusion of these technologies over a wide range of fields, including hydrology. On the other hand, the research community must address significant challenges in standardizing the methodologies adopted. All environmental variables (e.g., vegetation, soil moisture, and river flow) can be measured using different sensors and algorithms, but a comprehensive assessment of the performances of each of these methods and procedures is required. Such efforts may help to improve our capacity in describing the spatiotemporal processes at both the field and the river basin scale. Moreover, UAS technology can be easily integrated with other devices and tools (cell phone, fixed installations, etc.), allowing advances in agricultural practices and hydrometeorological monitoring. </p>

                Technology and scientific research have a clear path to follow that has already (largely) been traced by manned aerial photogrammetry and Earth observation from satellites. In fact, current observational practices have already addressed several of the problems that UAS-based observations are facing (e.g., image mosaicking, sensor calibration, radiometric calibration, etc.). Nevertheless, the ensemble of such problems connected to the proper use of UAS introduces a data processing complexity that is comparable to or slightly larger than that of satellites (see

                ) and makes their use difficult even for an experienced scientist without clear guidance.
            </p>
                  
            <p>There is a growing need to define harmonized approaches able to channel the efforts of all these studies and identify the optimal strategy for UAS-based monitoring. The challenge for the research is to define a clear and referenced workflow starting from the planning and acquisition of the data to the generation and interpretation of maps. In particular, we envisage the need to stimulate a comparative experiment able to assess the reliability of different procedures and a combination of algorithms in order to identify the most appropriate methodology for environmental monitoring in different hydroclimatic conditions. The definition of clear and specific procedures may also help in the definition of new legislation at the European scale, removing some of the actual restrictions that limit the potential use of UAS in a wider range of contexts.</p>
                  
            <p>Ultimately, it will be the integration of UAS platforms with different techniques, including traditional instruments, fixed and mobile camera surveys, satellite observations, and geomorphological analyses, that will almost certainly deliver an improved characterization of Earth and environmental systems. Apart from providing improved spatial and temporal coverage, such a strategy of integrated observation will inevitably improve our knowledge of agricultural, hydraulic, geomorphological, ecological, and hydrological dynamics, and provide a basis for advancing our understanding of process description and behavior across space and time scales. </p>
