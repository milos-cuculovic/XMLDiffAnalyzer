For this purpose, we use a bag of regression models built for the particular signals being monitored. The regression models enable the detection of deviations from the operation state without the necessity of labeling data. Therefore, our approach minimizes the requirement of using expert knowledge, in particular the knowledge related to the categorization of failures and the exact time of their occurrence, which is sometimes difficult to identify.</p></Deleted><Deleted pos="0:1:3:1:14">
