While UAS systems cannot compete with satellite imagery in terms of spatial coverage.</ref:node><ref:node id="./2">Matese et al. provided an intercomparison of the acquisition and processing costs of three different platforms (UAS, Aircraft, and Satellite). Their cost model parametrization allows the derivation of the relative cost for the different configurations, showing that UAS is the most cost-effective solution for fields of an extent equal to or less than 20 ha. Their quantitative analyses showed that the approximate total cost.</ref:node><diff:copy run="6" src="./4"></diff:copy></ref:node><diff:copy run="4" src="./1"></diff:copy></ref:node><diff:copy run="1" src="./2"></diff:copy></ref:node></diff:diff>
