Of course, the additional benefit of the UAS platform is that the temporal resolution is limited only by the number of flights (and power supply/battery capacity), so any cost equivalence is quickly overcome due to repeatability. The costs for acquiring UAS imagery are usually derived from the initial investment, the processing software, data storage, and associated (and ongoing) fieldwork expenses.
