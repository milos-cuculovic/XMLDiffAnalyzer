While UAS systems cannot compete with satellite imagery in terms of spatial coverage, they provide unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions unmatched by satellite alternatives. Furthermore, they do so at a fraction of the satellite acquisition cost if the area of interest has relatively small extent. For example, a newly tasked high-resolution natural color image (50 cm/pixel) from a satellite (e.g., GeoEye-1) can cost up to 3000 USD. On the other hand, the initial outlay to acquire a single UAS with a natural color camera can be less than 1000 USD (see <diff:copy run="2" src="/0/1/0/2/1"></diff:copy></ref:node><diff:copy run="7" src="./3"></diff:copy></ref:node><diff:copy run="4" src="./1"></diff:copy></ref:node><diff:copy run="1" src="./2"></diff:copy></ref:node></diff:diff>
